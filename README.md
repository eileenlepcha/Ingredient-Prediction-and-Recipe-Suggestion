# Ingredient-Prediction-and-Recipe-Suggestion
Using YOLOv8 and open ai to detect ingredients in an image and suggest recipes for the ingredients detected.

I trained a YOLOv8 model on a custom dataset of vegetables and fruits so as to create a basic ingredient detection model.
open ai is used for generating recipes from the detected ingredients(classes).

A sample of the predicted image(test6) has been uploaded, along with the results.png.
